## Overview

* Optimization

  Finding the best soultion from the set of feasible solutions. Each kind of optimization problem has three components: a **objective function, decision variable and set of constraints**.

  The **optimization** is also called as **mathematical programming** - collection of mathematical principles and methods used to solve a problem.

  

  Depending on the **decision variable**, broadly, the optimization is classified as follows

  * **Discrete** (aka  **Combinatorial**)

    This optimization deals with variables who take the values which are discrete.

  * **Continuous**
